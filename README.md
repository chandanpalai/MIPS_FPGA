# MIPS_FPGA
Goal - An open source MIPS processor running on an FPGA with a full instruction set. Included will also be a cross compiled version of a Linux distro to run on the FPGA
A full description of every last design choice will be uploaded in the future, but for the meantime I am documenting all work on my blog site.
